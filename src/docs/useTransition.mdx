Notes: 
 -`useTransition` lets you use local state within a function component.
 - Call signature: `const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()`
 - View the [docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useTransition)

## Marking State as Transition
Marking a state as transition is as simple as passing a synchronous function with the state you want to transition into the `startTransition` function returned by the `useTransition` hook.

```
const review=()=>{

  const [timeUpdate, setTimeUpdate] = useState(2)
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

  startTransition(()=>{
      // handle state change in here
      setTimeUpdate()
    })
  }
  ```

  ## Using in Class Components 
  The `useTransition` hook can only be used in a functional component. However, `react` provides us with a function that we can use in class components to transition a state change.
